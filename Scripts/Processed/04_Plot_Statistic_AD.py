# CODE DESCRIPTION
# 04_Plot_Statistic_AD.py plots the Anderson-Darling statistic between the observational and the NWP modelled
# climatology distributions.
# Note:
# The Anderson-Darling test for k-samples tests the null hypothesis that k-samples are drawn from the same population 
# without having to specify the distribution function of that population. 
#     1. If the Anderson-Darling statistic is bigger than the critical values, this means that the test results are significant at 
#         every significance level. Therefore, we would reject the null hypothesis of the test no matter which significance 
#         level we choose to use. Thus, we have sufficient evidence to say that the samples are not drawn from the same
#         population.
#     2. If the Anderson-Darling statistic is smaller than the critical values, this means that the test results are not 
#         significant at any significance level. Therefore, we would not reject the null hypothesis of the test. Thus, we donâ€™t 
#         have sufficient evidence to say that the samples are not drawn from the same population.
# Code runtime: ~ 1 minute.
