This study uses reanalysis and reforecasts to compute the NWP-modelled climatologies. Both types of datasets are pivotal in creating modelled climatologies, providing a structured understanding of long-term weather and climate patterns. They have, however, significant differences. Reanalyses integrate historical weather observations with state-of-the-art NWP models with consistent physics and data assimilation techniques. Such approach produces a continuous and homogenized dataset with high-resolution information on past atmospheric conditions that spans several decades. Hence, reanalysis can be used to study climate trends, variability, and anomalies, and to generate climatologies that serve as a baseline for comparison with current and future weather patterns. Reforecasts, also called hindcasts, involve running the current operational NWP model on historical data (typically, maximum 20 years in the past). Such a compatibility with current operational forecasts ensures that any biases identified in the reforecasts can be used to correct present forecasts and improve their reliability. Reforecasts can also be used to develop climatologies that are compatible with the current operational system.
